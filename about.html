            <p>Hi there - my name is Phill, I was born and raised in San Anselmo, Ca and currently live there with my wife
                (Kacey), 1 year old daughter
                (Naia) and our Lab/Shepherd mix (Dakota).
                <br>
                <br>
                Over the past 4 years i've been working at a sales software
                startup startup called
                Groove, where I headed the global product support team. I've always been interested in learning how
                things work "under the hood",
                so I've taken the leap to join a coding bootcamp called Rithm School for their July '22 cohort. I look forward to learning intimately about the software
                development process and make some cool things!
                <br>
                <br>
                As for hobbies, I love being outdoors and spending time with family and friends. In my spare time I like
                to hike, mountain
                bike and explore new places. I also really enjoy working on classic cars / motorcycles and generally
                just
                building things.
